# CLA bot signature storage and public information site

This repository stores the JSON signatures file for the CLA bot and displays the static webpage that presents the CLA legal document. 

The public-facing website is visible at https://roblox.github.io/cla-bot-store/.

For more information visit http://go/clabot.

**All files in this repo are publicly visible. Do not store anything in that file that should not be publicly visible.**

Do not manually modify the signatures file, the github action will fail if it is not kept in its proper format.

The contents of this repository are not considered secure as signatures are public information in the public repos where individuals have signed the CLA.
